I created Botmuie, a Discord bot, because my server needed something annoying. Botmuie has a lot of features, such as Open Music, Text-to-Speech, Gate Notification, and Annoying Reply. Additionally, he can change how he replies based on his mode. However, it's still in beta version and may have some issues. Since I don't have money to host it, I run it on my laptop, so it's only online when I have it open.

Sure, if you guys wants to invite Botmuie to your Discord server, you can use the following link: [Botmuie Invite Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1208700289948065845&permissions=8&scope=bot)
